# Patterns

## **Observer Pattern**

Observer Pattern in Unity: Decouple the sender (subject) from multiple receivers (observers) allowing them to react dynamically to changes. Use this pattern to notify UI elements, game state, or other components about specific events or changes in your Unity project. It's especially helpful for creating responsive interfaces, managing in-game events, and handling data synchronization between different parts of your game.


## **Command Pattern**

Command Pattern in Unity: Encapsulate a request as an object to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. Useful for input handling, AI, and UI actions.


## **Flyweight Pattern**

Flyweight Pattern in Unity: Optimize memory usage and performance by sharing common, intrinsic data across multiple similar game objects or entities. This pattern is ideal for scenarios where you have a large number of objects with shared characteristics, like particles, tiles, or other repetitive elements in your Unity game. By using the Flyweight Pattern, you can efficiently manage and render these objects, reducing memory overhead and improving the overall performance of your game.


# Tools & Assets

## **Rubicks Cube**

Creating a Dynamic Rubicks Cube can be a great challange to create for newly comers. This was my first attempt to create such of a tool which lead to develop my first Unity Asset for the Asset Store

## **Linked ScriptableObject**

Linked scriptableobjects is a great way to simplify sharing data across the objects. As you seen in the video the arrow shares its color with the LinkedSO and cube listens and updates the changes on the run. This way you don't need to dependencies of any sort.

## **Renderer**

This was my solution tool to easen getting unity scene objects as Textures with rendering them on the scene.
